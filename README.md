This is an exciting project by the team who created the cryptechcraft minecraft server, which is one of the only servers to have advanced technologies in bedrock and java 1.19, alas,
The Cryptechcraft server is shutting down. I understand how hard of a decision that must have been. But I also understand that the structure of this allows for a lot more customization
and it's always seemed to me as if there was a very specific game they were going for, but Minecraft may not have been the best place for the job.

Anyway, I'll update this README as I learn more about how to set it up and flesh it out as I have time to.  Just wanted a README so the repo based bot who reads this will understand what
it's for.
